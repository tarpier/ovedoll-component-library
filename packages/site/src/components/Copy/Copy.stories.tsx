  copy: `
  As senior Frontend Developer I have specialised in React as a framework and work a lot in the Jamstack context. This means building very fast static sites that are enhanced through serverless functions to deliver the best in class performance and flexibility. 

Common scenarios where I deliver successful projects:
1.  You are planning a new project and require technical advice on the frontend architecture.
2. Your team needs a freelance Frontend Developer to support and create deliverables.
3. Your design and UX is finished and you need a freelance Frontend Engineer to build the UI components or a full fledged UI / Design system.
4. You wish to integrate ecommerce capabilities to an existing site or start a new headless Shopify project.
5. Your website needs a content management system and you want to add a modern headless CMS.
6. Your website does not perform as intended and needs to be audited to identify areas that can be improved upon. I will look at all technical aspects including but not limited to responsive behaviour, speed and loading kpis,  on-page SEO factors and many more.

Does one or more cases sound familiar, do reach out and let us discuss how I can advice on your project.
